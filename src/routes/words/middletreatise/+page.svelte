    <h3>notes on the middle treatise</h3>
    <p>
        This is a document containing my work on the Middle Treatise, a 5th century Chinese Translation of an early Sanskrit commentary on Nagarjuna's Mūlamadhyamakakārikā. The English translation was done by Brian Bocking. My hope is that by publishing these I might find others to talk about Madhyamaka, emptiness, or Nagarjuna with, and from whom I might learn more about these topics from.

        These notes might be occasionally revised and updated. The title page will show the date of the latest revision.
