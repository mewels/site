the long-awaited (to nobody but myself...) debut of dead nymphs. i'd actually been recording personal demos under this name since 2022 but never felt anything was good enough for release. i always felt myself occupied by some other project, and so the tracks i'd been writing never reached completion. 

what changed in 2025 that i finally put this out? i think a cloud of things. inspired by watching mygo, ave mujica, and reading bocchi the rock in the last year, i'd decided to practice guitar with more intention, and finally began to feel like i had the capacity to actualize the sort of thing i wanted to make. i've also felt quite sad about the direction of my life after moving to seattle. i feel a bit like i've stalled out, or that i'm aging to the point where the goals i've had my whole life are starting to hurt me by their lack of fulfillment. so i wanted to push against that, to make a simple and direct expression of myself and my feelings. this, in my head, is what rock music is for.

ideally i'd like to have drums and bass as well here, but i didn't like the sound in demos i made where i programed them. i felt like it clashed with the live recorded guitar. if i can somehow acquire a bass i could probably be fine with programming drums. regardless, i was reassured as to the efficacy of the guitar-only approach by the wonderful music of the softies, which i have never felt to be lacking in richness or beauty.

this record also marks my first songs written on guitar that are more than just textures (as on the hello girl soundtrack) and the first time i sang on record.
