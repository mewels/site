This is a sample markdown document containing a few things that i want to test out. for instance, i would probably like to have a paragraph or so here about the album or release... the things that i liked about it, retroactive views, ideas i had at the time. things like that. possibly also the emotional framework of the album, what it meant to me, etc.
